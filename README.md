# Tic Tac Toe (Python + Tkinter)

An interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
Play against a friend (PvP) or challenge the computer (PvC) with different difficulty levels powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.


## Features
- Player vs Player (PvP) mode  
- Player vs Computer (PvC) mode with 3 difficulty levels:
  - Easy → random moves
  - Medium → mix of random and AI
  - Hard → full Minimax AI  
- Optional **“loser starts next game”** toggle  
- Dynamic scoreboard that resets when returning to the main menu  
- Supports multiple board sizes (3x3 to 5x5)  
- Simple and clean Tkinter GUI

## How It Works

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, which simulates all possible moves to choose the optimal one. Difficulty levels control whether the AI uses pure minimax, randomness, or a mix.
